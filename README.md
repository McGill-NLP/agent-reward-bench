# AgentRewardBench

## Using the `agent-reward-bench` library

This library provides a set of tools for evaluating the performance of agents in various environments. It includes a set of environments, a set of agents, and a set of evaluation metrics.

## Installation

To install the library:

```bash
pip install agent-reward-bench
```

You can now import the library in your Python code:

```python
# Using agents and environments:
import agent_reward_bench.modeling as arbm
import agent_reward_bench.benchmarks as arbb

# Using the judge for evaluating agents:
import agent_reward_bench.judge as arbj
from agent_reward_bench.judge.existing import aer, nnetnav
from agent_reward_bench.judge.args import default_judge_args, judge_args
```

See `scripts/run_agent.py` and `scripts/run_judge.py` for examples of how to use the library to run an agent in an environment.

## Judgments

First, make sure that the cleaned trajectories are in `trajectories/cleaned`. You can do this by downloading the official ones from Huggingface Hub and place them in the `trajectories/` folder, or see instructions below on how to generate them.

To run the judge, use the following command:
```bash
python scripts/run_judge.py
```

This will generate the output of the judge and save them to `trajectories/judgments` by default, which can be changed with the `--base_save_dir` argument.

## Generating trajectories

### Setup

First, clone this repo and create a virtual environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcgill-nlp/agent-reward-bench.git
cd po-web-agents
python3 -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt

playwright install
```

### Web Environments

To set up the environments, please see [gasse/webarena-setup](https://github.com/gasse/webarena-setup/) for WA and VWA, and [ServiceNow/WorkArena](https://github.com/ServiceNow/WorkArena/) for WorkArena and WorkArena++.

### Environment variables

You need to set the following environment variables for using the web environments.

```bash
# for workarena:
export SNOW_INSTANCE_URL="https://dev275972.service-now.com"
export SNOW_INSTANCE_UNAME="admin"
export SNOW_INSTANCE_PWD="<password>"

# for webarena:
export WA_HOMEPAGE="https://wa-homepage-${SUFFIX}.${WEBHOST}"
export WA_SHOPPING="https://wa-shopping-${SUFFIX}.${WEBHOST}/"
export WA_SHOPPING_ADMIN="https://wa-shopping-admin-${SUFFIX}.${WEBHOST}/admin"
export WA_REDDIT="https://wa-forum-${SUFFIX}.${WEBHOST}"
export WA_GITLAB="https://wa-gitlab-${SUFFIX}.${WEBHOST}"
export WA_WIKIPEDIA="https://wa-wikipedia-${SUFFIX}.${WEBHOST}/wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2022-05/A/User:The_other_Kiwix_guy/Landing"
export WA_MAP="https://wa-openstreetmap-${SUFFIX}.${WEBHOST}"
export WA_FULL_RESET="https://wa-reset-${SUFFIX}.${WEBHOST}"

# for visualwebarena:
export VWA_HOMEPAGE="https://vwa-homepage-${SUFFIX}.${WEBHOST}"
# ...
export VWA_FULL_RESET="https://vwa-reset-${SUFFIX}.${WEBHOST}"

export VWA_CLASSIFIEDS="https://vwa-classifieds-${SUFFIX}.${WEBHOST}"
export VWA_CLASSIFIEDS_RESET_TOKEN="4b61655535e7ed388f0d40a93600254c"
```

See `vars/set_envs.sh` for an example of how to set up the environment variables automatically.

You might want to set up various API keys for the different services. You can do this by by adding the following to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

```bash
export OPENAI_ORG_ID="your-openai-org-id"

# API keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export TOGETHER_API_KEY="your-together-api-key"
export VLLM_API_KEY="your-vllm-api-key"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"

export VLLM_BASE_URL="https://vllm.your.domain.com/v1"
export TOGETHER_BASE_URL="https://api.together.xyz/v1"
export OPENROUTER_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
```


### Running the agent

```bash
# For WA:
export SUFFIX="-v1"  # change this to your setup
export WEBHOST="your.domain.com" # change this to your web host
source vars/set_envs.sh  # set up the environment variables

# starting a new run
python run_agent.py --model "<name>" --benchmark "<benchmark>"

# e.g., for a gpt-4o agent on WA:
python run_agent.py --model "gpt-4o" --benchmark "webarena_100"
```

The accepted benchmarks and models can be found with the following commands:

```bash
python run_agent.py --help
```

### Processing trajectories

To process the trajectories, you can run:

```bash
python scripts/convert_trajectories_to_json.py
```

This will save the trajectories to `trajectories/processed` (make sure to set the `--base_save_dir` argument to the correct path). Then, you can further clean them (optional) by running:

```bash
python scripts/clean_processed_trajectories.py 
```
This will save the cleaned trajectories to `trajectories/cleaned` (make sure to set the `--base_save_dir` argument to the correct path).
